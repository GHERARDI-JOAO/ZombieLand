# Zombieland's Last Survivor

## Description
*Zombieland's Last Survivor* is a 2D game developed using the Greenfoot IDE in Java. The game was created as part of the final project for the *Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming* course.

The game consists of two phases:
- **First Phase:** The player controls a character positioned in the middle of the screen, shooting at incoming zombies to survive.
- **Second Phase:** The player is inside a stationary tank, and faster zombies try to reach them, challenging the player's defense skills.

## Features
- **Object-Oriented Design:** The project was structured using key OOP principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **Multiple Actor Classes:** Various classes represent the game actors, each with unique behaviors and interactions.
- **Different Game Worlds:** The game features distinct worlds for the main menu, instructions, gameplay, and results.
- **Sound and Immersion:** Background music and sound effects were integrated to enhance the gaming experience.
- **Scoring System:** A score is displayed throughout the game, with the playerâ€™s victory or defeat based on their performance.

## Installation
1. Download the Greenfoot IDE from the official website: [Greenfoot Download](https://www.greenfoot.org/download).
2. Clone or download the project files from the repository.
3. Open the project in Greenfoot and run the game.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Programming language used for game development.
- **Greenfoot IDE**: Integrated development environment for creating 2D games.

## Learning Outcomes
This project allowed me to apply Object-Oriented Programming concepts in a practical setting, developing my skills in programming, design, and problem-solving. It also provided an opportunity to work with the Greenfoot tool and improve my understanding of game development.
